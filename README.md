# Material design library

Thanks for [MaterialDesignLibrary](https://github.com/junwchina/MaterialDesignLibrary). This library implemented good material design views. But they are not conpliant with MD's [Metrics & Keylines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-keylines-spacing). So I did some changes and remove some views i would not use.


## Views in this library
* FlatButton
* CircleProgressBar
* RaisedButton
* Dialog (There are three kinds of dialogs. Mostly, it is enough in my project, also , i can extend them to finish some specific tasks)
